<H1> About Me </H1>
<P> I am currtenly solving problems from Interviewbit(Scaler) that are assigned to me. Ever since I have completed my engineering degree , never exposed to the interview problems and confidently solved them. Since, I have started practicing these problems, I thought of  creating this repository for the people who are trying to solve problems and who are stuck. It is advisable to contact this repository after your initial attempt to solve the problems (that is how we are learning to code :-)). May be who knows you come up with better version of algorithm </p>
